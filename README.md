<!--#echo json="package.json" key="description" -->
Trying to provide FOSS-friendly download options for lots Minecraft mods
currently imprisoned on CurseForge.
<!--/#echo -->



Motivation
----------

I was trying to simplify downloading a lot of the mods that I like to use.
[MultiMC should have been able to do it
](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/issues/5134)
but unfortunately
[CurseForge's TOS seem to be hostile towards free software.
](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/issues/4762)
CurseForge seems to also hate me, or rather, to be too afraid of me
for my privacy choices.
Fortunately, most of the mods that I'm interested in are free software,
so I should be able to provide them independently from CurseForge.
Let's lift that curse.
