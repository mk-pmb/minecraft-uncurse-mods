Fabric CI Artifacts
===================

Some of the jobs in the [WorldEdit CI builds
](https://builds.enginehub.org/job/worldedit?branch=version/7.2.x)
have produced artifacts whose names sound like they might work as
a replacement for files on CurseForge.
In a few cases I was able to compare them with the official Fabric
mod download, and they differed, thus only "replacement".
Needs more testing.

Let's collect specimen we discovered on the Wayback Machine,
to (1) preserve them and (2) provide a download option that
doesn't strain EngineHub's CI infrastructure.
